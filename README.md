## ***Objective***    
•	The main objective of this project is to analyze credit card usage and customer behavior through an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
•	It focuses on identifying key revenue sources, spending patterns, and customer segments based on demographics.  
•	Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, the project transforms raw data into meaningful business insights.  
•	The goal is to support better decision-making by visualizing trends and highlighting high-value customers.  

## ***Tasks Completed:***     
**1.	Data Collection & Cleaning (Excel):**   
    &emsp;•	Imported raw credit card usage data in .csv format.  
    &emsp;•	Removed null values, duplicate records, and corrected column formats.  
    &emsp;•	Standardized categorical variables (e.g., job titles, education levels).  
**2.	Data Management in SQL:**  
    &emsp;•	Created SQL database and structured multiple tables.  
    &emsp;•	Wrote SQL queries to filter important fields such as customer demographics, transaction amounts, and card types.  
    &emsp;•	Created views to summarize data and prepare for visualization.  
    &emsp;•	Joined tables to align customer data with transaction data.  
**3.	Power BI Dashboard Development:**  
    &emsp;•	Imported SQL views into Power BI and established relationships.  
    &emsp;•	Built a data model with calculated measures using DAX (e.g., total revenue, revenue by category, customer count by segment).

     &emsp;  &emsp;&emsp;o Transaction Analysis Dashboard  
    &emsp;•	Applied filters, slicers, and visuals like bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs for interactivity.  
**4.	Testing & Finalization:**  
    &emsp;•	Validated insights for accuracy by comparing with raw data.  
    &emsp;•	Refined visuals for better user experience and clarity.
